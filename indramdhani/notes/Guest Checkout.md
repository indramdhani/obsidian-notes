# Guest Checkout
## Notes

-   Guest checkout is a feature that allows the customer to directly checkout their shopping item without creating an account on the site.
-   user data should not be used for:
    -   email remarketing

## Guest checkout pros

-   reduce customer's account fatigue that can increase abandonment rates
-   relatively easier for mobile users
-   reduce blocker on checkout process / faster checkout process
-   it makes checkout seem like less work
-   still can provide a registration option
-   easyness of repeat purchases
-   order history tracking

## Guest checkout cons

-   difficulty reviewing, modifying or tracking orders
-   the inability to easily reorder products
-   a manual vs automatic processes needed for returns, exchanges or refund/credits
-   the inability to link a customer's order history/loyalty with other programs where accounts are necessary
-   customer service finding it time-consuming or difficult to assist shoppers with their orders

## Things to check before implementing guest checkout

-   Consider how often your customers are likely to shop with you. This will be related with
    
    -   customer loyalty
    -   repeated order (monthly order vs annual order)
    
    Guest checkout will be beneficial to those who are least likely to have frequent order from the same customers.
    
-   Think about whether or not reorders are likely
    
-   Returns, exchanges, and refunds are a hassle without an account
    
    -   frequency of items returns / refunds
-   Accounts are multi-purpose: consider the needs for memberships ...
    
-   Guest checkout is a great fit for some stores, but not for others
